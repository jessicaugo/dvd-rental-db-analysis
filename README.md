# The purpose of this project is to aid business stakeholders in making data-driven decisions using the data in the DVD Database. It will use the data to answer the question, “What are the top 10 cities in terms of sales?” The business will be able to use this information to help decide which cities would be most advantageous for adding new locations. The detailed table will also include information that could answer follow-up questions such as which countries these top cities are in and when the sales occurred. The results of the database queries show that currently, the top 10 cities in terms of sales are Saint-Denis, Cape Coral, Santa Brbara dOeste, Apeldoorn, Molodetno, Qomsheh, London, Memphis, Richmond Hill, and Tanza.
